Implementation of simple arithmetic expressions from
Chapter 3 of Pierce's 'Types and Programming Languages'

The evaluator is a big-step evaluator in Pierce's 
terminology.

The package provides an executable arith, which presents
the user with a REPL at which arithmetic expressions can be
typed. The sytem prints out a parse tree and the value
of the expression.

It was an experiment for me to see how to implement
a little language in Happy and Alex. In particular it uses
monadic lexers and parsers in order to gracefully recover from 
errors.
